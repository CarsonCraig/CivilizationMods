			<Text>Ashigarus trace their origin back to the 14th century of our era. At this time, ashigaru troops were formed of conscripts armed with hast weapons (ex: bill, spear). Over the years, their equipment diversified and integrated other weapons such bows and swords. However, it was during the 16th century with the introduction of the tanegashima, the Japanese matchlock arquebus, that the ashigarus entered their golden age. This weapon drastically changed the way to do the war and from then onwards turned ashigarus into full-fledged soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ashigarus are famous for distinguishing themselves during the pacification campaign of Japan by Nobunaga Oda, especially during the battle of Nagashino in 1575. Subsequently, it was during Hideyoshi's unification of Japan as well as during the Japanese invasions of Korea, also known as the "Imjin" war.</Text>
